# TDF_02-145 Arduino {#mainpage}
## Introduction
This is the repository for arduino and hardware related matters for robot for Autism Spectrum Disorder therapy development funded through HEC TDF. The documentation folder contains all the code for Arduino division of HEC funded project TDF 02-145. There are multiple files contained in this folder. This code will run on an Arduino Mega. 
## Wiring
This section details the Arduino wiring.

### Motor Wiring
 * ENA pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 8
 * ENB pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 9
 * IN1 pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 11
 * IN2 pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 10
 * IN3 pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 12
 * IN4 pin of L298N motor driver is connected to Arduino pin 13
 
### Encoder Wiring
 * Encoder pin from left motor is connected to Arduino pin 3
 * Encoder pin from right motor is connected to Arduino pin 2
 
### Servo Wiring
 * Servo for pitch movement (nodding of head - like when you indicate yes) of head is connected to Arduino pin 6 
 * Servo for yaw movement (shaking of head - like when you indicate no) of head is connected to Arduino pin 5
